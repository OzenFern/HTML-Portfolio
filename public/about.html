    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>Hello, I'm Ozen!</h2>
    <p>
      A Computer Science & Engineering student focused on becoming a data
      scientist and AI/ML practitioner. I am drawn to problems where data,
      logic, and uncertainty collide—and where good models matter more than
      flashy demos.
    </p>

    <p>
      My primary interests are data analysis, machine learning, and intelligent
      systems, with hands-on work in Python, statistics, and algorithmic
      thinking. I care about understanding why models work, not just how to run
      them, and I treat experimentation as a first-class skill.
    </p>

    <p>
      Web development is how I expand my reach. I use it to turn models into
      usable products, build dashboards, and ship ideas instead of leaving them
      trapped in notebooks. Clean interfaces and solid backend logic make data
      work visible, testable, and useful. Beyond code, I actively optimize how I
      learn—building systems for studying, knowledge management, and long-term
      skill growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently learning Japanese, which keeps me humble and reminds me
      that fluency—whether in language or code—comes from deliberate practice.
      This portfolio documents my projects, experiments, and progress as I grow
      into someone who can take data from raw signals to real-world impact.
